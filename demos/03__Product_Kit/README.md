# Product Kit Demo

This demo continues from the *AI Data Liaison Demo* and configures Ekaya Engine to become an embeddable, isolated text2sql server with RLS multi-tenant support.

Ekaya Product Kit allows product teams to run the core Ekaya Engine in their product environments safely and securely.

In this configuration, Ekaya Engine does not have any external system, database or datasource access and provides RLS-ready, SQL Injection-safe queries for each customer that the product call execute.

## Prerequisites

Ekaya Product Kit only works with PostgreSQL with tables using RLS on the customer tenant ID.

You have created a project in Ekaya via [../README.md] and have added the ontology as described in [../02__AI_Data_Liaison/README.md].

You have created Pre-Approved Queries for how you want your customers to be able to access their data.

## Setup

Coming Soon!

Contact [sales@ekaya.ai] if you need priority getting this setup.
